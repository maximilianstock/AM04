# Introduction and BBC iPlayer streaming data

<div class = "navy1">

The BBC is one of the oldest broadcasting organisations of the world. As a public service, its aim is to inform, educate, and entertain the UK population. Due to this broad mission, its key performance measures are not associated with financial profit but instead with how well it manages to engage the wider public with its program offering. To achieve its mission, it is particularly important to know which customer segments are interested in what content and how this drives their engagement with the BBC (often measured by how happy they are to pay for the TV licensing fees).

Traditionally, the BBC reached its audience through terrestrial broadcasting, first analogue and then digital, which made it difficult to monitor public engagement. This had to been done retrospectively by monitoring a relatively small sample of representative consumers who consented to having their TV-watching habits observed and recorded. More recently, the BBC launched a digital TV streaming service, the BBC iPlayer, which allows streaming BBC content on demand. Besides being a more convenient way to deliver content to the public, the streaming service allows the BBC to get a more detailed perspective of public engagement. In time, this should allow the BBC to better predict how different customer segments react to the programs it offers and become more effective in informing, educating, and entertaining them. 


The goal of this workshop is to use data mining techniques to gain a data-based view of BBC’s iPlayer customers and the content it provides.  

i) In the first step we will process the raw data for analysis. We need to clean and enrich the data. I have already completed this step and this will not be the focus of this workshop. 

ii)  We have an engagement based data and in the second step we will convert this to a user based data. Also we will engineer new features. The instructions for this step are provided in this RMarkdown file. Some of the code for these steps are provided and you are expected to complete the rest. (Expected time for completion: 45 minutes).

iii) In the third step you will create meaningful customer segments for the users of the BBC iPlayer. In this step you will use K-Means, K-Medoid and H-Clustering methods to determine meaningful clusters for iPlayer viewers. The instructions for this step is provided in this RMarkdown file as well.

The original data file contains information extracted from the BBC iPlayer database. The dataset was created by choosing approximately 10000 random viewers who watched something on iPlayer in January and then recording their viewing behaviour until the end of April. This means that customers who did not watch in January will not be in the dataset. Every row represents a viewing event. Given the way the data was created, during January the data is representative of what is watched on the iPlayer. After January the data is no longer representative as it is no longer a random sample of the people watching iPlayer content.

## How to get the most out of this exercise

<div class = "navy1">

First read the learning outcomes, which provides a list of things you should be doing in this exercise.

Although this is a group exercise, I reccomend you complete each step on your own before you confer with your teammates. The instructions and questions are designed to make you think about clustering beyond this specific example. Therefore, by going through these steps on your own, you will be able to meet the learning objectives I stated above.

One way of achieveing this would be setting a milestone for every step below. When all the group members achieve this milestone you can discuss what you find with your group mates.

I do not reccomend a division of labour among group members; as this will significantly reduce your learning from this exercise. 
</div>
# Cleaned Data

I have already processed and cleaned the original view data. In this step you will first generate a user-based database which we will use to train clustering algorithms to identify meaningful clusters in the data.

Let's load the cleaned data and investigate what's in the data. See below for column descriptions.

```{r Load data}
cleaned_BBC_Data <- read_csv(file="Results_Step1.csv",col_names = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
glimpse(cleaned_BBC_Data) 
```

<div class = "navy">
The column descriptions are as follows.

a)	user_id  -- a unique identifier for the viewer

b)	program_id and series_id -- these identify the program and the series that the program belongs to

c)	genre -- the programme’s genre (e.g., drama, factual, news, sport, comedy, etc)

d)	start_date_time -- the streaming start date/time of the event

e)	Streaming id -- a unique identifier per streaming event

f)	prog_duration_min -- the program duration in minutes

g)	time_viewed_min -- how long the customer watched the program in minutes

h)  duration_more_30s - equals 1 if the program duration is more than 30 seconds, equals 0 otherwise 

h)  time_viewed_more_5s - equals 1 if time_viewed is more than 5 seconds, equals 0 otherwise

i)  percentage_program_viewed -- percantage of the program viewed

j) watched_more_60_percent -- equals 1 if more than 60% of the program is watched, equals 0 otherwise

k) month, day, hour, weekend -- timing of the viewing

l) time_of_day -- equals “Night” if the viewing occurs between 22 and 6am, "Day" if it occurs between 6AM and 14, “Afternoon” if the it occurs between 14 and 17, “Evening” otherwise
</div>

Before we proceed let's consider the usage in January only.

```{r filter data}

cleaned_BBC_Data<-filter(cleaned_BBC_Data,month==1)
```



# User based data

We will try to create meaningful customer segments that describe users of the BBC iPlayer service. First we need to change the data to user based and generate a summary of their usage. 


## Data format


The data is presented to us in an event-based format (every row captures a viewing event). However we need to detect the differences between the general watching habits of users. 

How can you convert the current date set to a customer-based dataset (i.e., summarizes the general watching habits of each user). In what dimensions could BBC iPlayer users be differentiated? Can you come up with variables that capture these? Discuss these issues with your group and determine a strategy on how data must be processed

## Feature Engineering



For the workshop let’s generate the following variables for each user.


i.	Total number of shows watched and ii.	Total time spent watching shows on iPlayer by each user in the data

```{r total number of shows and time }
userData<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>% group_by(user_id) %>% summarise(noShows=n(), total_Time=sum(time_viewed_min)) 
```


iii.	Proportion of shows watched during the weekend for each user.

```{r percentage weekend}

#Let's find the number of shows on weekend and weekdays
userData2<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>% group_by(user_id,weekend) %>% summarise(noShows=n())

#Let's find percentage in weekend and weekday
userData3 = userData2%>% group_by(user_id) %>% mutate(weight_pct = noShows / sum(noShows))

#Let's create a data frame with each user in a row.
userData3<-select (userData3,-noShows)
userData3<-userData3%>% spread(weekend,weight_pct,fill=0) %>%as.data.frame()
#Let's merge the final result with the data frame from the previous step.
userdatall<-left_join(userData,userData3,by="user_id")
```


iv.	Proportion of shows watched during different times of day for each user.

```{r percentage time of day}

#Code in this block follows the same steps above.
userData2<-cleaned_BBC_Data %>% group_by(user_id,time_of_day) %>% summarise(noShows=n()) %>% mutate(weight_pct = noShows / sum(noShows))

userData4<-select (userData2,-c(noShows))
userData4<-spread(userData4,time_of_day,weight_pct,fill=0)

userdatall<-left_join(userdatall,userData4,by="user_id")
```

> Question 1.	Find the proportion of shows watched in each genre by each user. Your code below.

```{r percentage by genre}
#Your code here
q1 <- cleaned_BBC_Data %>% 
  group_by(user_id, genre) %>% 
  mutate(nGenre = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  mutate(nTotal = n(), shareGenre = nGenre/nTotal) %>% 
  group_by(user_id, genre, shareGenre) %>% 
  summarise()


#add your results to the data frame userdatall

userdatall <- left_join(userdatall, q1, by = "user_id")
userdatall <- userdatall %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = genre, values_from = shareGenre)

```


> Question 2. Add one more variable of your own. Describe why this might be useful for differentating viewers in 1 or 2 lines. Your code below.

```{r add one more variable}
#Your code here
q2 <- cleaned_BBC_Data %>% 
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  summarise(avgViewPerc = mean(percentage_program_viewed))

#add your results to the data frame userdatall
userdatall <- left_join(userdatall, q2, by = "user_id")

#we also create a factor variable for the type of user (light, heavy, medium) based on the number of shows to be able to see distributions amongst them.

userdatall <- userdatall %>% 
  mutate(userType = ifelse(noShows < 10, "light" , if_else(noShows >= 10 & noShows < 50, "medium", "heavy")))


userdatall <- userdatall %>%
  mutate(userType = factor(userType, levels = c("light", "medium", "heavy")))
```
 
# Visualizing user-based data
Next visualize the information captured in the user based data. Let's start with the correlations.

```{r correlations, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library("GGally")
userdatall %>% 
  select(-user_id) %>% #keep Y variable last
  ggcorr(method = c("pairwise", "pearson"), layout.exp = 3,label_round=2, label = TRUE,label_size = 2,hjust = 1)

```


> Question 3. Which variables are most correlated? What's the implication of this for clustering?


> Question 4. Investigate the distribution of noShows and total_Time using box-whisker plots and histograms. Explain what you observe in 1-2 sentences. Are you worried about outliers?


```{r}
#Insert your code here:
ggplot(userdatall, aes(x= noShows)) +
  geom_density()+
  theme_bw()

ggplot(userdatall, aes(x= total_Time)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_bw()

ggplot(userdatall, aes(x = userType, y = total_Time)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(0, 3500) + #we limit this graph to
  theme_bw()
  
  
```

## Delete infrequent users

Delete the records for users whose total view time is less than 5 minutes and who views 5 or fewer programs. These users are not very likely to be informative for clustering purposes. Or we can view these users as a ``low-engagement'' cluster. 


```{r delete}
userdata_red<-userdatall%>%filter(total_Time>=5)%>%filter(noShows>=5)
ggplot(userdata_red, aes(x=total_Time)) +geom_histogram(binwidth=25)+labs(x="Total Time Watched (mins)", y= "Count") + theme_bw()
glimpse(userdata_red)
```


# Clustering with K-Means

Now we are ready to find clusters in the BBC iPlayer viewers. We will start with the K-Means algorithm.

## Training a K-Means Model

Train a K-Means model. Start with 2 clusters and make sure you de-select `user_id` variable. Also don’t forget to scale the data. Use 50 random starts. Should we use more starts?

Also display the cluster sizes. See the RMarkdown file from the last session to identify the R functions you need for this and the tasks below.

Use `summary("kmeans Object")` to examine the components of the results of the clustering algorithm. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r fit kmean k2}
k=2
# Get rid of variables that you might not need. Do not include no shows as well because it is highly correlated with total time

kMeansUserdatall <- userdatall %>% 
  select(-c("user_id", "noShows", "userType")) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0)


#log transform total time to reduce the impact of outliers 
kMeansUserdatall <- kMeansUserdatall %>% 
  mutate(total_Time = log(total_Time))

#scale the data
kMeansUserdatall <- data.frame(scale(kMeansUserdatall))

sd(kMeansUserdatall$total_Time) #lets see if the scaling worked by looking at the standard deviation of, e.g., total_Time
```



```{r fit kmean k2}
#train kmeans clustering
KMeans2Clusters <- eclust(kMeansUserdatall, "kmeans", k = 2,nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)

#add clusters to the data frame
userdatallWithClusters <- mutate(userdatall, cluster = as.factor(KMeans2Clusters$cluster))
kMeansUserdatallWithClusters <- mutate(kMeansUserdatall, cluster = as.factor(KMeans2Clusters$cluster))
```

## Visualizing the results

### Cluster centers 
Plot the normalized cluster centers. Try to describe the clusters that the algorithm suggests. 

```{r cluster centers}
#your code here

#First generate a new data frame with cluster centers and cluster numbers
userClusterCenters <- data.frame(cluster = as.factor(c(1:2)), KMeans2Clusters$centers)

#transpose this data frame
userClusterCentersTransposed <- userClusterCenters %>% gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

graphUserClusters <- ggplot(userClusterCentersTransposed, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster, group = cluster),  size = 1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),)

graphUserClusters


```

Can you interpret each cluster from this plot? Did you arrive at meaningful clusters?

How can you use the cluster information to improve the viewer experience with BBC iPlayer? We will come back to these points below. However it is important to think about these issues at the beginning.


### Clusters vs variables

Plot a scatter plot for the viewers with respect to total_Time and weekend variables with color set to the cluster number of the user. What do you observe? Which variable seems to play a more prominent role in determining the clusters of users?

```{r distribution wrt. variables}
#your code here
ggplot(kMeansUserdatallWithClusters, aes(x = total_Time, y = weekend, color =  as.factor(cluster))) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  labs(color = "Cluster") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Clusters vs PCA components

Repeat the previous step and use the first two principle components using `fviz_cluster` function.
```{r cluster centers 2}

fviz_cluster(KMeans2Clusters, userdatall, palette = "Set2", ggtheme = theme_bw(), geom="point", pointsize = 0.5)


```

### Clusters vs PCA components without log transform

As a "side exercise", use K-means method again but this time do not log transform `total time` and include `no_shows` as well. Compare your results to the case when you use log transformation. Then visualize the first two principle components using `fviz_cluster` function.

```{r cluster centers without log transform}
#your code here
kMeansUserdatallOutliers <- userdatall %>% 
  select(-c("user_id", "userType")) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

```{r cluster centers without log transform}
#scale the data
kMeansUserdatallOutliers <- data.frame(scale(kMeansUserdatallOutliers))

sd(kMeansUserdatallOutliers$total_Time) #lets see if the scaling worked by looking at the standard deviation of, e.g., total_Time
```



```{r fit kmean k3}
#train kmeans clustering
KMeans2ClustersOutliers <- eclust(kMeansUserdatallOutliers, "kmeans", k = 2,nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)

#add clusters to the data frame
kMeansUserdatallWithClustersOutliers <- mutate(kMeansUserdatallOutliers, cluster = as.factor(KMeans2ClustersOutliers$cluster))
```


```{r cluster centers}
#your code here

#First generate a new data frame with cluster centers and cluster numbers
userClusterCentersOutliers <- data.frame(cluster = as.factor(c(1:2)), KMeans2ClustersOutliers$centers)

#transpose this data frame
userClusterCentersTransposedOutliers <- userClusterCentersOutliers %>% gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)

graphUserClustersOutliers <- ggplot(userClusterCentersTransposedOutliers, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster, group = cluster),  size = 1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),)

graphUserClustersOutliers


```


```{r distribution wrt. variables}
#your code here
ggplot(kMeansUserdatallWithClustersOutliers, aes(x = total_Time, y = weekend, color =  as.factor(cluster))) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  labs(color = "Cluster") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Clusters vs PCA components

Repeat the previous step and use the first two principle components using `fviz_cluster` function.
```{r cluster centers 2}

fviz_cluster(KMeans2ClustersOutliers, userdatall, palette = "Set2", ggtheme = theme_bw(), geom="point", pointsize = 0.5)


```

Do you observe any outliers? 


## Elbow Chart

Produce an elbow chart and identify a reasonable range for the number of clusters. 


```{r elbow}

#Here is a short way of producing the elbow chart using "fviz_nbclust" function. 
fviz_nbclust(kMeansUserdatall,kmeans, method = "wss", k.max = 20)+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")

```

## Silhouette method

Repeat the previous step for Silhouette analysis.

```{r Silhouette}
fviz_nbclust(kMeansUserdatall, kmeans, method = "silhouette",k.max = 20)

```


> Question 5: Summarize the conclusions of your Elbow Chart and Silhoutte analysis. What range of values for the number of clusters seems more plausible?





## Comparing k-means with different k

>Question 6: For simplicity let's focus on lower values. Now find the clusters using kmeans for k=3, 4 and 5. Plot the centers and check the number of observations in each cluster. Based on these graphs which one seems to be more plausible? Which clusters are observable in each case? Don't forget to check the cluster sizes.

Your code here.

```{r }
#Fit kmeans models
KMeans3Clusters <- eclust(kMeansUserdatall, "kmeans", k = 3,nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)
KMeans4Clusters <- eclust(kMeansUserdatall, "kmeans", k = 4,nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)
KMeans5Clusters <- eclust(kMeansUserdatall, "kmeans", k = 5,nstart = 50, graph = FALSE)
```

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height = 12}
#Plot centers
#your code here

#First generate a new data frame with cluster centers and cluster numbers
userClusterCenters3 <- data.frame(cluster = as.factor(c(1:3)), KMeans3Clusters$centers)
userClusterCenters4 <- data.frame(cluster = as.factor(c(1:4)), KMeans4Clusters$centers)
userClusterCenters5 <- data.frame(cluster = as.factor(c(1:5)), KMeans5Clusters$centers)

#transpose this data frame
userClusterCentersTransposed3 <- userClusterCenters3 %>% gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)
userClusterCentersTransposed4 <- userClusterCenters4 %>% gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)
userClusterCentersTransposed5 <- userClusterCenters5 %>% gather(variable,value,-cluster,factor_key = TRUE)


ggplot(userClusterCentersTransposed3, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster, group = cluster),  size = 1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),) +
  labs(subtitle = paste("Cluster 1:", KMeans3Clusters$size[1], "\nCluster 2:",KMeans3Clusters$size[2], "\nCluster 3:", KMeans3Clusters$size[3]))

ggplot(userClusterCentersTransposed4, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster, group = cluster),  size = 1)+

  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),) +
  labs(subtitle = paste("Cluster 1:", KMeans4Clusters$size[1], "\nCluster 2:",KMeans4Clusters$size[2], "\nCluster 3:", KMeans4Clusters$size[3], "\nCluster 4:", KMeans4Clusters$size[4]))

ggplot(userClusterCentersTransposed5, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = cluster, group = cluster),  size = 1)+
  geom_point(size=1,shape=4) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),) +
  labs(subtitle = paste("Cluster 1:", KMeans5Clusters$size[1], "\nCluster 2:",KMeans5Clusters$size[2], "\nCluster 3:", KMeans5Clusters$size[3], "\nCluster 4:", KMeans5Clusters$size[4], "\nCluster 5:", KMeans5Clusters$size[5]))


```





# Comparing results of different clustering algorithms

## PAM

Fit a PAM model for the k value you chose above for k-means. Determine how many points each cluster has. Plot the centers of the clusters and produce PCA visualization.



```{r }
#your code here

```




## H-Clustering

Use Hierercahial clustering with the same k you chose above. Set hc_method equal to `average` and then `ward.D`. What differences do you observe between the results of these two methods? Visualize the results using dendrograms. How many points does each cluster have? Plot the centers of the clusters and produce PCA visualization.

```{r h-cluster}
#your code here

```

Plot the centers of H-clusters and compare the results with K-Means and PAM.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height = 12}
#your code here

```

>Question 7: Based on the results of these three methods, what can you conclude?



# Subsample check

At this stage you must have chosen the number of clusters. We will try to reinforce your conclusions and verify that they are not due to chance by dividing the data into two equal parts. Use K-means clustering, fixing the number of clusters to your choice, in these two data sets separately. If you get similar looking clusters, you can rest assured that you conclusions are robust. If not you might want to reconsider your decision.

```{r out of sample check,eval = FALSE}

library(rsample)
#the following code chunk splits the data into two. Replace ... with your data frame that contains the data
set.seed(1234)
train_test_split <- initial_split(..., prop = 0.5)
testing <- testing(train_test_split) #50% of the data is set aside for testing
training <- training(train_test_split) #50% of the data is set aside for training

#Fit k-means to each dataset and compare your results


```

>Question 8: Based on the results, what can you conclude? Are you more or less confident in your results?




# Conclusions

>Question 9: In plain English, explain which clusters you can confidently conclude that exist in the data, based on all your analysis in this exercise.

>Do you think you chose the right `k`? Explain you reasoning.

>What assumptions do you think your results are sensitive to? How can you check the robustness of your conclusions? Just explain, you don't have to carry out the analysis.


>Finally explain how the information about these clusters can be used to improve viewer experience for BBC or other online video streaming services.
